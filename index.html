        <p>
            Manga is the form in which Japanese comics or comics are known. The creator of the term "manga" (漫画) was
            <br>
            Hokusai Katsushika, a renowned painter of the Japanese ukiyo-e movement. <br>
            Este pintor unió los kanjis de la palabra informal (漫 man) y dibujo (画 ga) que podría traducirse en el <br>
            sentido más literal como “dibujos informales” o “garabatos”. Por otra parte, al autor que se encarga de <br>
            ilustrar o dibujar los mangas, se le conoce como mangaka. No obstante, en el mundo occidental, la palabra se
            <br>
            used to refer very specifically to the Japanese style of illustration and comics specifically <br>
            japanese.

        <h3>Article 1:</h3>
        <p>
            It is presumed that the first comics were created around the year 1790, and originated due to the arrival of <br>
            people from the West to Japan. This style of drawing, however, became very popular among the Japanese. The <br>
            first steps of the manga are tied to two types of traditional artistic expressions: Japanese graphic art <br>
            dating from the XI and the indisputable influence of the world of Western comics, which had already won its <br>
            place in the entertainment medium during the 19th century.
