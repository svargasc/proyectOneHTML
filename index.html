    <h1>Manga history</h1>
    <div id="secction1">
        <p>
            Manga is the form in which Japanese comics or comics are known. The creator of the term "manga" (漫画) was <br>
            Hokusai Katsushika, a renowned painter of the Japanese ukiyo-e movement . <br>
            <strong><em>This painter combined the kanjis for the word informal (漫 man) and drawing (画 ga)</em></strong> which could be translated <br>
            in the most literal sense as “informal drawings” or “doodles”. On the other hand, the author who is in <br>
            charge of illustrating or drawing the manga is known as mangaka . However, in the Western world, the word is <br>
            used to refer very specifically to the Japanese style of illustration and specifically Japanese comics. <br>

        <h2>First comics (1790 - 1887)</h2>
        <h3>Article 1:</h3>
        <p>
            It is presumed that the first comics were created around the year 1790, and originated due to the arrival of
            <br>
            people from the West to Japan. This style of drawing, however, became very popular among the Japanese. The
            <br>
            first steps of the manga are tied to two types of traditional artistic expressions: Japanese graphic art
            <br>
            dating from the XI and the indisputable influence of the world of Western comics, which had already won its
            <br>
            place in the entertainment medium during the 19th century.

        <h2>Children's comics: the kodomo manga (1920-1930)</h2>
        <p>
            The best moment that the manga lived is between the 1920s and 1930s, since it focused specifically on young
            <br>
            people and children. During these years, the kodomo manga genre emerged, with works such as The Adventures
            <br>
            of Shochan (1923) by Shousei Oda and The <strong>Three Musketeers with Boots on their Heads (1930)</strong>
            by Taisei Makino
            <br>
            and Suimei Imoto. Thanks to this, manga began to be exported outside of Japan for consumption as <br>
            entertainment.

        <h2>Osamu Tezuka, Pioneer of Modern Manga (1946)</h2>
        <img src="./images/img2.jpg" width="350px" alt="astro boy images">
        <p>
            During that time, <strong><em>Osamu Tezuka, a 20-year-old</em></strong> student who was enthusiastic about
            Disney and Fleischer <br>
            animations, would be the cause of a drastic change in Japanese manga. <br>
            The New Treasure Island is one of his most important works, which gained popularity thanks to the <br>
            application of a cinema-like style that included fluid action scenes and sound effects. This work came to
            <br>
            market almost more than 700 thousand copies. <br>
        </p>
        <h2>Massification of manga (1959)</h2>
        <p>
            With the economic boom, the Japanese people needed more manga production. Due to this demand, one of the
            <br>
            major book publishers, Kōdansha , began to inquire into the magazine market in 1959. <br>
            Shonen Magazine changed the monthly schedule and turned it into a weekly one, which increased production and
            <br>
            managed to pay its authors better salaries. Inevitably, other publishing groups would appear, including <br>
            Shueisha , Futabasha or Shōgakukan. <br>

        <h2>Manga types</h2>
        <p>
            It is mistakenly believed that manga is classified by genre, but in reality the way to differentiate it is
            <br>
            based on the type of audience it is addressed to. For this, the following terms are used: <br>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Kodomo manga , for young children</li>
            <li>Shōnen manga, for young teenagers</li>
            <li>Shōjo manga, for teenage girls.</li>
            <li>Seinen manga , for young and adult men.</li>
            <li>Josei manga , for young and adult women.</li>
        </ul>
